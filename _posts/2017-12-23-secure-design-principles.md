Sitting hear on a cold, snowy day thinking about secure design principles. These are key to think about during the design phase of a feature/project?

  * Total Mediation &#8211; every access to every resource must be validated every time
  * Economy of Mechanism &#8211; keep it as simple as possible
  * Fail-Safe &#8211; in case of failure, default to a secure state
  * Defense in Depth &#8211; layer security
  * Open Design &#8211; the security of a system should not be dependent on secrecy of its design or implementation
  * Psychological Acceptability &#8211; security mechanisms must not make resources more difficult to access then if they weren&#8217;t there
  * Least Privilege &#8211; limit access to a system/feature to only those that \*need\* to access it for the shortest duration possible
  * Minimize attack surface &#8211; reduce risk by reducing the attack surface area
  * Secure Defaults &#8211; default to a secure state

Any others you can think of?
