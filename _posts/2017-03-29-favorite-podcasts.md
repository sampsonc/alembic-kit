I&#8217;ve been spending most of my commute these days listening to podcasts.  I&#8217;ve found a few good ones, but am looking for ideas.   Security/development is my vocation, but I like a variety of things to listen to.

Currently I&#8217;m listening to-

  * The Art of Charm
  * The Changelog
  * The Complete Privacy & Security Podcast
  * Entrepeneur On Fire
  * Greater than Code
  * How I Built This
  * The James Altucher Show
  * The Marie Forleo Podcast
  * Nutrition Facts by Dr. Greger
  * Residual Income Podcast
  * Risky Business
  * Side School Hustle
  * Soft Skill Engineering
  * Stuff You Should Know
  * SUCCESS Insuder
  * Team Never Quit Podcast
  * The Tim Ferriss Show
  * Why Are Computers
  * Advanced Persistent Security

Any other suggestions?
