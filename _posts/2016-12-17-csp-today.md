Playing around with Content Security Policy (CSP) today. Â Found these resources so far that I like.

  * <a href="http://cspisawesome.com/" target="_blank">CSP Is Awesome</a>
  * <a href="https://report-uri.io" target="_blank">Report URI</a>
  * <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/" target="_blank">Content Security Policy (CSP) Quick Reference Guide</a>

Any other suggestions?
