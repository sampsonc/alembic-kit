So excited to be speaking at DerbyCon 7.0 this year! After attending every year since the conference started, I decided to submit a talk this year and it was accepted. The title of the talk is &#8220;Extending Burp&#8221;. I&#8217;ll run through how to create Burp extensions and some gotcha&#8217;s that I figured out.

Hope to see you there!
