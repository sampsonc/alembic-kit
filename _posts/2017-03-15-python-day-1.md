### Well&#8230;PHP isn&#8217;t really an option. Â Only Ruby or Python Â ðŸ™‚

As many of you may know, I started off right out of college doing C/C++ programming and finished my software development days with Java. Â  Since then Iâ€™ve been doing application security. Â  When I do program now, itâ€™s mainly for my own uses and itâ€™s typically in Ruby.

I became interested in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) when Metasploit was ported to Ruby. Â  But in general, the prominent language for scripting related to security is Python. Â So, I decided to experiment more with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Right off the bat Iâ€™ve found a few things that are _annoying_&#8211;

  * White-space scoping. Â  This is a common complaint if youâ€™re used to languages that are more free-form and have explicit ways to scope. Â But, in modern editors take care of it for you and it does enforce a consistent style. Â It still bugs me some, though.
  * Library compatibly between versions. Â There seem to be two major versions &#8211; 2.7X and 3.0. Â Iâ€™ve not really done enough to know the difference, but there does seem to be a difference in community support for libraries between the two.
  * OO. Â There are couple of interesting things about this. Â  First, why the explicit self parameter as the first parameter to every method? Â Second, things like the len function. Â It is used to determine the length of many different types of data. Â  But things like lists, should have a len method IMHO. Â They do have a \_\_len\_\_ method, but nothing Iâ€™ve read talks about calling it. Â  It seems like the standalone len function expects itâ€™s target to have a \_\_len\_\_ function so it knows how to get the length. Â Why not just have len on the target? Â It just seems not well thought-out.

Thoughts?
