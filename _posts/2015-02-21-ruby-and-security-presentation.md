So, a couple of weeks ago I presented to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/indyowasp/" title="Indy OWASP Chapter" target="_blank">Indy OWASP Chapter</a> about a topic near and dear to my heart- ruby and security. I really had a great time creating and giving the presentation and hope to expand it for a future talk.
