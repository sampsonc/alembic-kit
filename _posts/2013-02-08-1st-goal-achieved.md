Well, I achieved my first technical goal of 2013- contribute to an open source application. I just submitted a plugin for the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project" title="OWASP Zed AttackProxy (ZAP) Project" target="_blank">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a> project. The plugin adds a context menu to the tree of sites that allows you to recursively expand/collapse the node based on it&#8217;s current state. I originally talked about doing it last summer, so I&#8217;m only a little late. ðŸ™‚
