I&#8217;m so excited. My first experiment with creating and publishing a ruby gem seems to have been successful! As of this post it&#8217;s been downloaded 1069 times in the past 4 days. PwnedCheck is a ruby gem that I wrote that checks an email address against the new site by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TroyHunt" title="Troy Hunt" target="_blank">Troy Hunt</a> called <a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com" title="haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a>. His site aggregates password dumps from breaches and allows you to check to see if your password has been compromised. Use it as follows-

### Installation

<pre lang="ruby" line="0">gem install PwnedCheck
</pre>

### Usage:

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">require 'pwnedcheck'

# The 3 cases.
# foo@bar.com is a valid address on the site
# foo232323ce23ewd@bar.com is a valid address, but not on the site
# foo.bar.com is an invalid format
addresses = ['foo@bar.com', 'foo232323ce23ewd@bar.com', 'foo.bar.com']

addresses.each do |address|
  begin
    sites = PwnedCheck::check(address)
    if sites.length == 0
      puts "#{address} --> Not found on http://haveibeenpwned.com"
    else
      sites.each do |site|
        puts "#{address} --> #{site}"
      end
    end
  rescue PwnedCheck::InvalidEmail => e
    puts "#{address} --> #{e.message}"
  end
end
</pre>
