I've updated jekyll-clicky to version 0.1.3.  This fixes an issue where some posts weren't getting the javascript code and changed it to be asynchronous..

Check it out at <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-clicky" target="_blank">RubyGems</a> and find the source at <a href="https://github.com/sampsonc/jekyll-clicky" target="_blank">Github</a>.
