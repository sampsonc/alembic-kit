Those of you that know me know that books are my vice. I have a ton of books. I have them at my house, in my car, at my office, etc. I have paperbacks, hardbacks, and e-books. I&#8217;ve recently started bringing in a few to work each day in order to reduce clutter at my house.

Anyway&#8230;

I stumbled across this reading list -> <a href="http://dfir.org/?q=node/8" title="http://dfir.org/?q=node/8" target="_blank">http://dfir.org/?q=node/8</a> which is a great list by <a href="https://twitter.com/attrc" title="Andrew Case" target="_blank">@attrc</a> that breaks down books by subject and skill level. If you are looking for good books on security, this is definitely something to check out. And if you live near me, ping me and I most likely have them if you would like to borrow. ðŸ™‚
