I am an Application Security Specialist and Software Engineer. My main interests are in web application security, secure coding / design, and enterprise application development. In my spare time I lead the <a href="http://www.owasp.org" target="_blank">OWASP</a> Indianapolis chapter and likes to work on open-source projects. I&#8217;m also involved with Boy Scouts and Northview Church.
